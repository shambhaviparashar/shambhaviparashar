# Hello, I'm Shambhavi Parashar

I am a **Back-End Software Engineer** with 3+ years of experience building secure, scalable payment solutions that meet the rigorous demands of financial systems. Currently, I'm pursuing a Master of Science in Computer Science at NJIT while engineering systems that are as dependable as your most trusted financial institution.

With expertise in .NET, RabbitMQ, SQL, and microservices architectures, I design solutions that balance performance with compliance—much like a well-managed ledger.

## About Me

- **Specialties**: Payment processing, PCI-DSS compliance, system scalability, and secure back-end engineering.
- **Philosophy**: Just as banks rely on precision and trust, I believe simplicity in design leads to robust solutions. (After all, if your code were any more complicated, it might need its own audit!)
- **Technical Toolkit**: .NET (C#), Python, SQL, Go, Java, JavaScript, RabbitMQ, Docker, AWS, and more.

For further details on my background and projects, please refer to my [portfolio](https://shambhaviparashar.me).

## Let's Connect

My portfolio, LinkedIn, and additional professional details are all in my resume—because who needs another brochure when you've got code?

*Feel free to reach out or explore my repos. If you break something, you get to keep both pieces.*  
And if you spot a bug, consider it a complimentary audit—your keen eye is the market correction my code never knew it needed!

Remember, I design systems with the reliability of a bank vault, but with just enough personality to keep things interesting.

*Note: I strive for balance in both my code and my commitments—just like a well-managed portfolio.*
